Description:
This dataset contains the observation and simulation data used for the article: Evaluation of the added value of the model grid-spacing on the precipitation phase.
It contains Observation data from Hydro-Québec hydrometeorological station network, UQAM-PK meteorological station and Site NEIGE foret Monmorency meteorological station.
The simulation data from the Canadian Regional Climate Model (CRCM6) at 0.11° and 0.0225° grid spacing and the reforematted data for ERA5-Land, CaPA and Daymet are aslo included.
The data are available for both periode of 2020-10 to 2021-05 and 2021-10 to 2022-05.
